### Topologies

- [X] topology on a set
- [X] topology generated by a base (a family of subsets closed under finite intersections)
- [X] examples
  - [X] trivial topology
  - [X] discrete topology

### Continuous maps

- [X] definition of a continuous map (inverse image preserves opens)
- [X] identity map is continuous
- [X] constant map is continuous
- [X] composition of continuous maps is continuous
- [X] every map from space with discrete topology is continuous
- [X] every map to space with indiscrete topology is continuous
- [X] definition of a homeomorphism
- [X] identity map is a homeomorphism
- [X] compositions of homeomorphism is homeomorphism
- [X] inverse of homeomorphism is homeomorphism

### Properties of spaces

- [X] Topological properties: T₀, T₁, T₂, regular

### Cantor space ℂ
